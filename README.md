# Project 2
# âœ… Project Overview: Retail Analytics Pipeline on Azure
This project showcases the implementation of a retail sales data pipeline using Azure Data Factory and SQL Server. It simulates a real-world scenario where sales data is ingested from an on-premises SQL Server and loaded into an Azure SQL Database for analysis and reporting.

ðŸ’¡ Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build a robust, automated, and scalable data pipeline that:

Connects to an on-premises SQL Server using a Self-hosted Integration Runtime

Ingests retail sales data via Azure Data Factory with dynamic parameterization and ForEach activity

Loads the data into a target Azure SQL Database

Prepares the data for downstream analytics and visualization using Power BI or other tools

ðŸ§± Database Design
Created a database named SalesOrdersDB with the following tables:

Customers

Orders

OrderDetails

These tables represent essential entities in a retail sales environment and are structured to support joins and transformations during data ingestion.

ðŸš€ Data Pipeline Setup
Built an ADF pipeline to automate data ingestion

Used Copy Data activity with dynamic content and parameterization

Configured a trigger to schedule the pipeline execution
